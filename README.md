### This repository provides solutions for OpenAI Gym games using reinforcement learning algorithms implemented in Jupyter notebooks. 


## CartPole

The CartPole game involves balancing a pole on a cart by moving the cart left and right. The goal is to keep the pole balanced for as long as possible.

Results: The agent lasts up to the timelimit of the code (3:20 minutes). The following resources are available for this solution:

- Notebook: `CartPole_notebook.ipynb`
- Model weights: attached as `CartPole.pth`

The solution for the CartPole game uses a Deep Q-learning. The algorithm is implemented in the `CartPole.ipynb` notebook.

## Breakout

The Breakout game involves breaking bricks by bouncing a ball off a paddle. The goal is to break all the bricks without losing all your lives.

Results: The agent achieves on 1 game (1 live): 102 rewards &  396 score on greedy policy. The following resources are available for this solution:
